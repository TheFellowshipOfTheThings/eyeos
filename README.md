EyeOS - GNU Affero General Public License


## Context

EyeOS was an open source web desktop with many features, released under AGPL.
Actually, the creators of EyeOS decided in September 2011 to change the license of their product to a non-FLOSS one.
Please visit [Wikipedia page for EyeOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeOS) for more details.


## License
GNU Affero General Public License


## Code
PHP, JavaScript, XML


## Version
The version given here (EyeOS 2.5) seems to be the last stable release of FLOSS EyeOS; it was released on May 14, 2011.
Please note that since the change of their license, EyeOS creators also changed their versioning numbers for their proprietary product, which was first released as 1.0.
Again, visit [Wikipedia page for EyeOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeOS) for more details.



## Thanks

Even if they decided to leave the FLOSS model, [creators of EyeOS](http://eyeos.org) made a tremendous job with this software.
Thank you EyeOS team!
